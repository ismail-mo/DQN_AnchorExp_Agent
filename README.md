# DQN_AnchorExp_Agent
Code and experiment logs from my BEng Civil Engineering dissertation, where I implemented a Deep Q-Network in PyTorch to optimise anchor-expansion for bio-inspired soil penetration. Includes Box2D simulation environment, custom reward functions based on cavity-expansion theory, Colab GPU training scripts, and reproducible post-processing with NumPy and Matplotlib.
