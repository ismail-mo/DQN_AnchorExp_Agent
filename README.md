# DQN_AnchorExp_Agent
A collection of reinforcement-learning environments and training scripts for simulating bioinspired burrowing behaviors. This project implements two custom OpenAI-Gymâ€“style environments in Box2D and solves each with a DQN agent.

To run, create a folder called 'simulations'. Then, copy the folders in this repository into the simulations folder. Then run this line from that directory: 'python -m agents.train_ae_DQN --episodes 2000'
